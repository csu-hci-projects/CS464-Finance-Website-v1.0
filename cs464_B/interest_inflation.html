	<h2>The Basics</h2>
	<br>
	<p>Interest and inflation are two foundational financial concepts. By understanding interest and inflation, you will be better equipped to understand and manage your finances. </p>
	<br>
	<h3>Inflation</h3>
  		<p>Inflation is the general increase in prices over time. Knowing about inflation is important because <b>inflation decreases spending power</b>. Spending power is the value your money holds. This is important, because a lot of personal finance boils down to making sure you don’t lose spending power (in other words, making sure your money grows equal to or beats the rate of inflation). 
</p>
	<p>
		<div>For example, in 1970 a loaf of bread was $0.70, and today a loaf of bread is $4.68. That’s due to inflation. In our bread example, having $1.00 in 1970 would buy you a loaf of bread, whereas having $1.00 today wouldn’t buy you even half a loaf of bread. Your dollar has lost spending power due to inflation. </div>
	</p>
	
	<br>
	
<h3>Interest</h3>
  		<div><p>Interest is money that is paid as a fee for using someone else’s money. Interest is used to combat the power of inflation. </div> 
  			</p>
  						<h5>Compound Interest</h5>
  						<div><p>Interest is also a way for you to make money through the power of compound interest. Compound interest is <b>earning interest on your interest</b>, and it is a very powerful tool. Compound interest can be compounded at different intervals: annually, quarterly, monthly, or daily. The more often your interest is compounded, the more interest you will earn. This is because you earn interest on your interest more often.</div> 
  						</p>
  						<p>
  						<div>For example, if you had $10,000 in a bank with a 10% interest rate for 10 years, if compounded annually you’d end up with $15,937.42. If compounded monthly, you’d earn $17,070.41.

</div>

  			
  			

  						<h5>Loans and Interest</h5>
  						<p>
  						<div>Banks and other entities that loan money charge interest so they don’t lose spending power due to inflation. Having a lower interest rate is beneficial to the person taking out the loan. To keep the amount you are paying in interest to a minimum, it is often best to pay back the loan as fast as you can so that your interest amount is minimal. Though you are going to be paying more money monthly to pay back the loan, in the long run you are going to be paying back less money overall. Make sure that you are able to afford the monthly payments before taking out the loan so you don’t end up in debt. Make sure you compare different loans before taking one to ensure you end up paying the least amount of interest possible.</div>
  						</p>
  						<p>
  						<div> For example, if you borrowed $10,000 from the bank at a 4% interest rate on a 5 year loan, you’d make monthly payments of $187.17. You’d pay $1,049.91 in interest, and $11,049.91 overall. If you borrowed $10,000 from the bank at a 4% interest rate on a 8 year loan, you’d make monthly payments of $121.89. You’d pay $1,701.70 in interest, and $11,701.70 overall.
