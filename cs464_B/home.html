<div class="container">
	<h1>1. Interest and Inflation</h1>
	
	<br>
	<p>Interest and inflation are two foundational financial concepts. By understanding interest and inflation, you will be better equipped to understand and manage your finances. </p>
	<br>
	<h3>Inflation</h3>
  		<p>Inflation is the general increase in prices over time. Knowing about inflation is important because <b>inflation decreases spending power</b>. Spending power is the value your money holds. This is important, because a lot of personal finance boils down to making sure you don’t lose spending power (in other words, making sure your money grows equal to or beats the rate of inflation). 
</p>
	<p>
		<div>For example, in 1970 a loaf of bread was $0.70, and today a loaf of bread is $4.68. That’s due to inflation. In our bread example, having $1.00 in 1970 would buy you a loaf of bread, whereas having $1.00 today wouldn’t buy you even half a loaf of bread. Your dollar has lost spending power due to inflation. </div>
	</p>
	
	<br>
	

<h3>Interest</h3>
  		<div><p>Interest is money that is paid as a fee for using someone else’s money. Interest is used to combat the power of inflation. </div> 
  			</p>
  						<h5>Compound Interest</h5>
  						<div><p>Interest is also a way for you to make money through the power of compound interest. Compound interest is <b>earning interest on your interest</b>, and it is a very powerful tool. Compound interest can be compounded at different intervals: annually, quarterly, monthly, or daily. The more often your interest is compounded, the more interest you will earn. This is because you earn interest on your interest more often.</div> 
  						</p>
  						<p>
  						<div>For example, if you had $10,000 in a bank with a 10% interest rate for 10 years, if compounded annually you’d end up with $15,937.42. If compounded monthly, you’d earn $17,070.41. 
  						</p>
  						<p></p>

  						 </p>
</div>

  			
  			

  						<h5>Loans and Interest</h5>
  						<p>
  						<div>Banks and other entities that loan money charge interest so they don’t lose spending power due to inflation. Having a lower interest rate is beneficial to the person taking out the loan. To keep the amount you are paying in interest to a minimum, it is often best to pay back the loan as fast as you can so that your interest amount is minimal. Though you are going to be paying more money monthly to pay back the loan, in the long run you are going to be paying back less money overall. Make sure that you are able to afford the monthly payments before taking out the loan so you don’t end up in debt. Make sure you compare different loans before taking one to ensure you end up paying the least amount of interest possible.</div>
  						</p>
  						<p>
  						<div> For example, if you borrowed $10,000 from the bank at a 4% interest rate on a 5 year loan, you’d make monthly payments of $187.17. You’d pay $1,049.91 in interest, and $11,049.91 overall. If you borrowed $10,000 from the bank at a 4% interest rate on a 8 year loan, you’d make monthly payments of $121.89. You’d pay $1,701.70 in interest, and $11,701.70 overall.

	<h1>2. Money Management</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Understanding how to manage your money is an important first step to having good financial health. </p>
	
	<br>

		<h3>Budgeting</h3>
		<p>
  		<div>Budgeting is an important tool for making sure you are managing your finances well. A budget will help you see where you spend your money and help you make sure you don’t spend more money than you have. As a general rule of thumb, you should spend about 50% of your income on necessities (ex: housing, utilities, food, insurance, etc...), 20% of your income to savings and/or repaying debt, and 30% of your income to wants (ex: shopping, meals out, etc...).</div>
		</p>
		<p>
		<div>An easy tool to start budgeting is Intuit’s Mint. After linking your bank accounts and credit cards, Mint will automatically track what you spend money on and categorize it for you so you can get a better sense of your budget. </div></p>

	<br>
	
   <h3>Saving</h3>
   <p>
  		<div>Saving is a vital aspect of money management.</div> 
  		</p>
  			<h5>Ways to Save</h5>
  						
  							<ul>
  								<li><b>Checking account:</b> account that is designed for everyday money transactions. Checking accounts are very liquid.</li>
  								<li><b>Savings account:</b> account that is designed to save money and earn some interest over time. Savings accounts are liquid, though some may have restrictions such as minimum account balance or withdrawl limits.</li>
  								<li><b>Money Market account:</b> account where the interest rates fluctuates with the market. They typically offer higher interest rates than savings accounts, but usually require fairly high minimum balances. Because of this, it is not as liquid as a savings or checking account.</li>
  								<li><b>Certificate of Deposit (CD):</b> a savings certificate that has a fixed interest rate and matures at a fixed date. When the certificate matures, you get your money back with interest. Because of this, it is not as liquid as a money market account, savings account, or checking account.</li>
  							</ul>
  				
  		
  			

  						<h5>Saving vs. Repaying Debt</h5>
  						<p>
  						<div>In general, it’s better to pay off debt before saving money. Debt usually has higher interest, and therefore it will be most beneficial to pay off the debt first before saving.</div> 
  						</p>
  						<div><p>For example, if you have $1000 in credit card debt at a 10% interest rate and paid it off in 12 months, you’d have paid $88 per month. This would have costed you $1056 total, with $56 paid in interest. </p>
							<p>If you instead saved the money you would have used to pay off the debt, you likely wouldn’t be able to find an interest rate greater than your 10% credit card interest rate. Let’s say you had a money market account with a 2% interest rate. With $1000 over a 12 month period compounded monthly, you’d have $1020.18, earning $20.18 in interest. Because you are earning less by saving than you would have to pay in debt, it’s smarter financially to pay off the debt first.
</p>

					</div>
  			
  					
  			
  						<h3>Emergency Fund</h3>
  						<p>
  						<div>One of the first financial goals you should have is to build an emergency fund. Emergencies happen, and it’s important to make sure you are financially ready should an emergency happen to you. As a general rule of thumb, you should save between 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid emergency fund. For an explanation of a liquid vs. non-liquid asset, see below.</div>
  						</p>
  					
  						<h5>Liquid vs Non-liquid</h5>
  						
  							<ul>
  								<li><b>Liquid asset:</b> an asset where you can get money quickly. For example, a checking or a savings account is a liquid asset.</li>
  								<li><b>Non-liquid asset:</b> an asset where you can not get money quickly. For example, if you own a house that is considered a non-liquid asset because there isn’t any guarantee your house will sell quickly.</li>
  							</ul>
  				
  						
  					
  					
  	
			
			<br>
			
	
		<h3>Taxes</h3>
		<p>
  		<div>In the US, money that you earn is taxed by the government. The government takes a portion of the money you earn and uses that money for things like national defense, social security benefits, infrastructure like roads and highways, etc...It’s important to take taxes into account when determining how much income you’ll actually take home.</div>
		</p>
		<p>
		<div>An easy tool to to your taxes is Intuit’s Turbo Tax. It's a free and easy to use tool to get your taxes done.</div>
		</p>
		<p class="text-center"><a href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary center">Get started with Turbo Tax here</a></p>

	
	<br>
			
			<h3>Credit</h3>
			<p>
  		<div>Your credit score is a number that represents your ability to pay your bills and pay them on time. Credit scores are very important for things like getting a good mortgage, getting lower insurance premiums, getting credit cards, etc... Credit scores range from 300-850. As a general rule of thumb, a credit score of 650 or greater is considered good credit.  </div>
		</p>
		<p>
		<div>For example, banks use your credit score to determine if you can get a loan and what interest rate they will charge you for a loan (which can cost or save you thousands of dollars), insurance companies use them to help determine your insurance rates, landlords or bosses may use them to determine if you’d be a responsible tenant or a responsible employee, credit card companies use them to determine your credit limit, etc...</div>
	
	</p>
	<p>
		<div> You are able to get a free copy of your credit report from each of the major credit reporting companies, Equifax®, Experian®, and TransUnion®, once each year (3 times total a year).

	<h1>3. Investing</h1>
	<br>
	
	<p>Investing your money is important because it helps grow your money and helps make your money work for you. Investing is a great tool to use to grow and diversify your portfolio.</p>
	
	<br>
	
<h3>Diversification</h3>
<p>
  		<div>Perhaps the most important concept in investing is diversification. Diversification means putting your money in a variety of financial vessels. Diversification is important because it lowers the level of risk in investing.
		</div>
		</p>
	
		<div><p>For example, imagine you lived on an island where there were only two companies - one company sold sunscreen and one sold umbrellas. If you were to invest your entire portfolio in the company selling sunscreen, you would see strong performance during the sunny parts of the year, but poor performance when it rains. The reverse would occur if you placed all of your assets in the other company as well. Most investors would prefer to have steady and constant returns. The solution in this case might be to invest 50% in one company and 50% in the other. The result of this diversification is that you would have decent performance throughout the year, as opposed to excellent performance at one time and terrible at another.</p>

	 <h3>Stocks and Bonds</h3>
	 <p>
  		<div>The basic building blocks of investments</div> 
  		</p>
  			<h5>Stocks</h5>
  			<p>
  						<div> A stock is a share in the ownership of a company. Companies sell shares of stock (equity) of their company to shareholders to get money to grow their business. If the company is doing well, your stock share values may go up. If the company is not doing well, your stock share values may go down. As the old adage goes, you want to buy low and sell high.</div> 
  						</p>
  						<p><b>Pros and cons: </p></b>
  							<p><b>Pros:</b> They have great potential to grow in value over time, and tend to have better performance and return on your investment in the long haul. </p>
							<p><b>Cons:</b> Stocks tend to be more volatile than bonds, meaning that their value goes up and down (fluctuates) more over short periods of time. This makes them a bit more of a risky investment.</p>

  			
  			
  					<h3>Bonds</h3>
  					<p>
  						<div>A bond is a type of “I.O.U.”. When you buy a bond, you are lending money to whoever is issuing the bond (A company, government agency, corporation etc..), and in return you get interest on top of your original loan, thus making money on your investment. Interest payments are paid at a specific interest rate over a fixed time period. </div>
  						</p>
  						<div><p><b>Pros and cons: </b></p>
  							<p><b>Pros:</b> Because the interest rate and time period are known, bonds are less volatile and risky than stocks.</p>
							<p><b>Cons:</b> They don’t have the growth potential that stocks do, so on average they are have worse performance than stocks in the long run. </p>
  					
			
			<br>
			
			
		</div>
	


	<h3>Mutual Funds and ETFs</h3>
	<p>
  		<div>Investing in mutual funds and ETFs are easy ways to gain diversification in your portfolio</div> 
  			</p>
  					<h5><b>Mutual Funds</b></h5>
  					<p>
  						<div>A mutual fund is a collection of stocks, bonds, and other investments that is managed by a professional team. Individuals can buy shares in a mutual fund and all of the money is pooled. Mutual funds are often actively managed, meaning that the manager of the mutual fund then uses that money to buy and sell stocks, bonds, and other investments to increase the mutual fund’s value over time and try and beat the market. Mutual funds vary in their investments. Some mutual funds may only invest in stocks, whereas others may invest in only bonds, whereas some invest in a mix of stocks and bonds. </div> 
  						</p>
  						<div><p><b>Pros and cons:</b></p>
  							<p><b>Pros:</b> The huge advantage to mutual funds is that you gain diversification at a very low price. 
</p>
							<p><b>Cons:</b> Since it is professionally managed, you don’t have as much control over your investment. There are also sometimes fees associated with a mutual fund or a large initial investment barrier which could be a detractor to potential investors.</p>
  					
  			
  			
  					<h3>ETFs</h3>
  					<p>
  						<div>An ETF is an exchange-traded fund. ETFs are very similar to mutual funds. Just like mutual funds, an ETF is a collection of stocks, bonds, and other investments. ETFs generally try and track an index, meaning they are usually passively managed. This means  that there isn’t a management team making investment decisions. The goal of passive management is to generate a return that is the same as a chosen index (an index is a measurement of the stock market) rather than outperforming it. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs are traded like common stock and their price varies throughout a day. </div>
  						</p>
  						<p><b>Pros and cons: </b></p>
  							<p><b>Pros:</b> Like mutual funds, ETFs are advantageous because you gain diversification at a very low price. ETFs often have lower fees and lower initial investment barriers than mutual funds. 
</p>
							<p><b>Cons:</b> Compared to individual stocks, ETFs often have higher fees.</p>
  					
	

	<br>
	
	<h3>Retirement</h3>
	<p>
  		<div>Since retirement is such a big investment and topic, it has its own section!
		</p>

	</div>
	
	<br>
	
	</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="container">
	<h1>4. Retirement</h1>
	<br>
	
	<p>Saving for retirement is very important. When you retire and won’t have a job, you will need money from your retirement savings to use as income. It’s important to start saving for retirement early. With retirement savings vessels, you often can’t withdraw money early without penalty. Thus, it is important to understand how saving for retirement works and the different vessels you can use to save for retirement. 
	</p>
	
	<br>
	
	 <h3>IRAs</h3>
  		<div><p>An IRA is an individual retirement account. It is an account that holds your investments, rather than an investment itself. For example, you can open an IRA at a brokerage, then you can select what you want to invest in, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs. </p>
  				<p>IRAs offer tax advantages to savers. There are two main types of IRAs, a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. You can use an IRA to save for retirement even if you already have a workplace retirement plan like a 401k. </p>
  		</div> 
  			<h5><b>Traditional IRA</b></h5>
  			<p>
  						<div>With a traditional IRA, money that you put in will be fully or partially tax deductible. This means you aren’t taxed on the money you put into your traditional IRA. When you withdraw money from your traditional IRA in retirement, you will be taxed on the money you withdraw as ordinary income. <b>In short, you don’t pay taxes when you contribute, you pay taxes when you withdraw. </b> If you are in your peak earning years and have high taxes now, and expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, a traditional IRA might be a good choice. </div> 
  						</p>
  						<div><p><b>Pros and cons: </b></p>
  							<p><b>Pros:</b> Reduce your tax bill today. Anyone can contribute to a traditional IRA, there are no income limits.
 </p>
							<p><b>Cons:</b>You are taxed when you take money out in retirement </p>


  			
  			
  					<h5><b>Roth IRA</b></h5>
  					<p>
  						<div>With a Roth IRA, money you put in is not tax deductible. This means that you are taxed on the money you put into a Roth IRA. However, the money you put in and your investment earnings grow tax free, meaning that you don’t pay taxes when you withdraw money from your Roth IRA in retirement. <b>In short, you pay taxes when you contribute, you don’t pay taxes when you withdraw.</b> If you are in a lower tax bracket now than you think will be in retirement, a Roth IRA might be a good choice. </div>
  						</p>
  						<div\><p><b>Pros and cons: </b></p>
  							<p><b>Pros:</b> Money you take out in retirement will be tax free. </p>
							<p><b>Cons:</b> No immediate tax deduction. You aren’t eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA if you earn too much money. </p>
  					</div>

			<br>
			
	
	<h3>401k</h3>
	<p>
  		<div>A 401k is an employer sponsored retirement plan. With a 401(k), you can decide how much of your salary you want to contribute on a pre-tax basis (meaning you won’t pay taxes on it today), up to a certain limit. When you withdraw money from your 401(k) in retirement, you will pay taxes on the money you withdraw. Like IRAs, once you have money in your 401(k), you can choose how you want to invest your money, such as in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs based on the choices offered by your employer. 
		</div>
		</p>
	
		<div><p>Some employers offer 401(k) matching programs, contributing a certain amount of money for every dollar you contribute. There are often limits to employer match programs. For example, an employer might match 50% of your contributions ($0.50 for every $1.00 you contribute) up to 6% of your salary. Employer matches are essentially free money, so you should try and maximize your employer’s match.</p>
		
		
		
		</div>

	
	<br>
	
		<h3>Social Security</h3>
		<p>
  		<div>Social security is a government program designed to help retirees, workers that have become disabled, and to survivors of deceased workers. Americans workers pay a social security tax on their income (half payed by you, half payed by your employer) to fund Social Security benefits. You don’t have a personal Social Security savings account, rather that money is pooled with everyone else’s social security tax into a large pot. Then, that money is paid out to those who are currently eligible for them. When you become eligible for Social Security benefits, you get to collect them instead of paying for the benefits of others. 
		</div>
