        <p>Interest and inflation are two foundational financial concepts</p>
      </div>

<div class="container">
	<h2>The Basics</h2>
	<br>
	
	<div class="card">
		<div class="card-header bg-info"><b>Inflation</b></div>
  		<div class="card-body">Inflation is the general increase in prices over time. Knowing about inflation is important because <b>inflation decreases spending power</b>. Spending power is the value your money holds. This is important, because a lot of personal finance boils down to making sure you don’t lose spending power (in other words, making sure your money grows equal to or beats the rate of inflation). 
</div>
		<hr id="examples">
		<div class="card-body">For example, in 1970 a loaf of bread was $0.70, and today a loaf of bread is $4.68. That’s due to inflation. In our bread example, having $1.00 in 1970 would buy you a loaf of bread, whereas having $1.00 today wouldn’t buy you even half a loaf of bread. Your dollar has lost spending power due to inflation. </div>

    <div class="card">
  		<div class="card-header bg-success"><b>Interest</b></div>
  		<div class="card-body">Interest is money that is paid as a fee for using someone else’s money. Interest is used to combat the power of inflation. </div> 
  			<div class="card-deck ml-3 mr-3 mb-3">
  					<div class="card">
  						<div class="card-header bg-primary"><b>Compound Interest</b></div>
  						<div class="card-body">Interest is also a way for you to make money through the power of compound interest. Compound interest is <b>earning interest on your interest</b>, and it is a very powerful tool. </div> 
  						<hr id="examples">
  						<div class="card-body">For example, if you hold $1,000.00 in a savings account that pays 5% interest each year, if you didn’t touch that money, after 20 years you’d have $2,653.30. You’d have earned $1,653.30 dollars in interest, more than doubling your initial investment.</div>
  					</div>
  			
  			
  					<div class="card">
  						<div class="card-header bg-warning"><b>Loans and Interest</b></div>
  						<div class="card-body">Banks and other entities that loan money charge interest so they don’t lose spending power due to inflation.</div>
  						<hr id="examples">
  						<div class="card-body">For example, if a bank is loaning someone $10,000 for a house, they will charge interest. For this example, if the bank charged you 5% interest and you repaid the loan in 10 years, you’d pay the bank back $12,727.86 total. The extra $2,727.86 you payed the bank is how much interest you paid on the loan. </div>

<div class="card">
		<div class="card-header bg-info"><b>Inflation</b></div>
  		<div class="card-body">As mentioned above, inflation increases prices over time. With rising prices also come an increased cost of living. Cost of living is exactly what it sounds like: how much money you need to pay for basic things such as housing, food, taxes, and health care. It is important to ensure that you have enough money to cover your cost of living expenses accounting for inflation. That’s why it’s important to consider inflation when thinking about money management, budgeting, and saving for retirement. 
</div>
		<hr id="examples">
		<div class="card-body">For example, let’s say you have a $30,000 salary and you receive a 2% raise. You’d now have a salary of $30,600. But, if the inflation rate is greater than 2%, then you are actually losing spending power even with your salary raise. In order to make sure that inflation doesn’t increase your spending power, it is important to earn equal to or more than the rate of inflation. </div>

  					<div class="card">
  						<div class="card-header bg-primary"><b>Compound Interest</b></div>
  						<div class="card-body">Compound interest is an extremely powerful concept. By earning interest on your interest, you can utilize compound interest to grow your money. Compound interest can be compounded at different intervals: annually, quarterly, monthly, or daily. The more often your interest is compounded, the more interest you will earn. This is because you earn interest on your interest more often.</div> 
  						<hr id="examples">
  						<div class="card-body">For example, if you had $10,000 in a bank with a 10% interest rate for 10 years, if compounded annually you’d end up with $15,937.42. If compounded annually, you’d earn $17,070.41.

  					<div class="card">
  						<div class="card-header bg-warning"><b>Loans and Interest</b></div>
  						<div class="card-body">In the context of loans, having a lower interest rate is beneficial to the person taking out the loan. To keep the amount you are paying in interest to a minimum, it is often best to pay back the loan as fast as you can so that your interest amount is minimal. Though you are going to be paying more money monthly to pay back the loan, in the long run you are going to be paying back less money overall. Make sure that you are able to afford the monthly payments before taking out the loan so you don’t end up in debt. Make sure you compare different loans before taking one to ensure you end up paying the least amount of interest possible.</div>
  						<hr id="examples">
  						<div class="card-body"> For example, if you borrowed $10,000 from the bank at a 4% interest rate on a 5 year loan, you’d make monthly payments of $187.17. You’d pay $1,049.91 in interest, and $11,049.91 overall. If you borrowed $10,000 from the bank at a 4% interest rate on a 8 year loan, you’d make monthly payments of $121.89. You’d pay $1,701.70 in interest, and $11,701.70 overall.
