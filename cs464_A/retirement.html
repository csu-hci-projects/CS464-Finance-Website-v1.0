	<h2>The Basics</h2>
	<br>
	
	<p>Saving for retirement is very important. When you retire and won’t have a job, you will need money from your retirement savings to use as income. It’s important to start saving for retirement early. With retirement savings vessels, you often can’t withdraw money early without penalty. Thus, it is important to understand how saving for retirement works and the different vessels you can use to save for retirement.

	 <div class="card">
  		<div class="card-header bg-success"><b>IRAs</b></div>
  		<div class="card-body"><p>An IRA is an individual retirement account. It is an account that holds your investments, rather than an investment itself. For example, you can open an IRA at a brokerage, then you can select what you want to invest in, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs. </p>
  				<p>IRAs offer tax advantages to savers. There are two main types of IRAs, a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. You can use an IRA to save for retirement even if you already have a workplace retirement plan like a 401k. </p>
  		</div> 
  			<div class="card-deck ml-3 mr-3 mb-3">
  					<div class="card">
  						<div class="card-header bg-primary"><b>Traditional IRA</b></div>
  						<div class="card-body">With a traditional IRA, money that you put in will be fully or partially tax deductible. This means you aren’t taxed on the money you put into your traditional IRA. When you withdraw money from your traditional IRA in retirement, you will be taxed on the money you withdraw as ordinary income. <b>In short, you don’t pay taxes when you contribute, you pay taxes when you withdraw. </b> If you are in your peak earning years and have high taxes now, and expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, a traditional IRA might be a good choice. </div> 
  						<hr id="examples">
  						<div class="card-body"><h5><b>Pros and cons: </b></h5>
  							<p><b>Pros:</b> Reduce your tax bill today. Anyone can contribute to a traditional IRA, there are no income limits.
 </p>
							<p><b>Cons:</b>You are taxed when you take money out in retirement </p>
</div>
  					</div>
  			
  			
  					<div class="card">
  						<div class="card-header bg-warning"><b>Roth IRA</b></div>
  						<div class="card-body">With a Roth IRA, money you put in is not tax deductible. This means that you are taxed on the money you put into a Roth IRA. However, the money you put in and your investment earnings grow tax free, meaning that you don’t pay taxes when you withdraw money from your Roth IRA in retirement. <b>In short, you pay taxes when you contribute, you don’t pay taxes when you withdraw.</b> If you are in a lower tax bracket now than you think will be in retirement, a Roth IRA might be a good choice. </div>
  						<hr id="examples">
  						<div class="card-body"><h5><b>Pros and cons: </b></h5>
  							<p><b>Pros:</b> Money you take out in retirement will be tax free. </p>
							<p><b>Cons:</b> No immediate tax deduction. You aren’t eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA if you earn too much money. </p>

	<div class="card">
		<div class="card-header bg-info"><b>401k</b></div>
  		<div class="card-body">A 401k is an employer sponsored retirement plan. With a 401(k), you can decide how much of your salary you want to contribute on a pre-tax basis (meaning you won’t pay taxes on it today), up to a certain limit. When you withdraw money from your 401(k) in retirement, you will pay taxes on the money you withdraw. Like IRAs, once you have money in your 401(k), you can choose how you want to invest your money, such as in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs based on the choices offered by your employer. 
		</div>
		<hr id="examples">
		<div class="card-body"><p>Some employers offer 401(k) matching programs, contributing a certain amount of money for every dollar you contribute. There are often limits to employer match programs. For example, an employer might match 50% of your contributions ($0.50 for every $1.00 you contribute) up to 6% of your salary. Employer matches are essentially free money, so you should try and maximize your employer’s match.</p>

		<div class="card">
		<div class="card-header bg-danger"><b>Social Security</b></div>
  		<div class="card-body">Social security is a government program designed to help retirees, workers that have become disabled, and to survivors of deceased workers. Americans workers pay a social security tax on their income (half payed by you, half payed by your employer) to fund Social Security benefits. You don’t have a personal Social Security savings account, rather that money is pooled with everyone else’s social security tax into a large pot. Then, that money is paid out to those who are currently eligible for them. When you become eligible for Social Security benefits, you get to collect them instead of paying for the benefits of others.
