		<div class="card-header bg-info"><b>Budgeting</b></div>
  		<div class="card-body">Budgeting is an important tool for making sure you are managing your finances well. A budget will help you see where you spend your money and help you make sure you don’t spend more money than you have. As a general rule of thumb, you should spend about 50% of your income on necessities (ex: housing, utilities, food, insurance, etc...), 20% of your income to savings and/or repaying debt, and 30% of your income to wants (ex: shopping, meals out, etc...).</div>
		<hr id="examples">
		<div class="card-body">An easy tool to start budgeting is Intuit’s Mint. After linking your bank accounts and credit cards, Mint will automatically track what you spend money on and categorize it for you so you can get a better sense of your budget. </div>

  						<div class="card-header bg-primary"><b>Ways to Save</b></div>
  						<div class="card-body"> 
  							<ul>
  								<li><b>Checking account:</b> account that is designed for everyday money transactions. Checking accounts are very liquid.</li>
  								<li><b>Savings account:</b> account that is designed to save money and earn some interest over time. Savings accounts are liquid, though some may have restrictions such as minimum account balance or withdrawl limits.</li>
  								<li><b>Money Market account:</b> account where the interest rates fluctuates with the market. They typically offer higher interest rates than savings accounts, but usually require fairly high minimum balances. Because of this, it is not as liquid as a savings or checking account.</li>
  								<li><b>Certificate of Deposit (CD):</b> a savings certificate that has a fixed interest rate and matures at a fixed date. When the certificate matures, you get your money back with interest. Because of this, it is not as liquid as a money market account, savings account, or checking account.</li>
  							</ul>

  			<div class="card">
  						<div class="card-header bg-secondary"><b>Saving vs. Repaying Debt</b></div>
  						<div class="card-body">In general, it’s better to pay off debt before saving money. Debt usually has higher interest, and therefore it will be most beneficial to pay off the debt first before saving.</div> 
  						<hr id="examples">
  						<div class="card-body"><p>For example, if you have $1000 in credit card debt at a 10% interest rate and paid it off in 12 months, you’d have paid $88 per month. This would have costed you $1056 total, with $56 paid in interest. </p>
							<p>If you instead saved the money you would have used to pay off the debt, you likely wouldn’t be able to find an interest rate greater than your 10% credit card interest rate. Let’s say you had a money market account with a 2% interest rate. With $1000 over a 12 month period compounded monthly, you’d have $1020.18, earning $20.18 in interest. Because you are earning less by saving than you would have to pay in debt, it’s smarter financially to pay off the debt first.

  						<div class="card-header bg-warning"><b>Emergency Fund</b></div>
  						<div class="card-body">One of the first financial goals you should have is to build an emergency fund. Emergencies happen, and it’s important to make sure you are financially ready should an emergency happen to you. As a general rule of thumb, you should save between 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid emergency fund. For an explanation of a liquid vs. non-liquid asset, see below.</div>

  								<li><b>Non-liquid asset:</b> an asset where you can not get money quickly. For example, if you own a house that is considered a non-liquid asset because there isn’t any guarantee your house will sell quickly.</li>

  		<div class="card-body">In the US, money that you earn is taxed by the government. The government takes a portion of the money you earn and uses that money for things like national defense, social security benefits, infrastructure like roads and highways, etc...It’s important to take taxes into account when determining how much income you’ll actually take home.</div>

		<div class="card-header bg-warning"><b>Credit</b></div>
  		<div class="card-body">Your credit score is a number that represents your ability to pay your bills and pay them on time. Credit scores are very important for things like getting a good mortgage, getting lower insurance premiums, getting credit cards, etc... Credit scores range from 300-850. As a general rule of thumb, a credit score of 650 or greater is considered good credit.  </div>
		<hr id="examples">
		<div class="card-body">For example, banks use your credit score to determine if you can get a loan and what interest rate they will charge you for a loan (which can cost or save you thousands of dollars), insurance companies use them to help determine your insurance rates, landlords or bosses may use them to determine if you’d be a responsible tenant or a responsible employee, credit card companies use them to determine your credit limit, etc...</div>
