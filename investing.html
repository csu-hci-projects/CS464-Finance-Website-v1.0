	<h2>The Basics</h2>
	<br>
	
	<p>Investing your money is important because it helps grow your money and helps make your money work for you. Investing is a great tool to use to grow and diversify your portfolio.</p>
	
	<br>
	
<div class="card">
		<div class="card-header bg-info"><b>Diversification</b></div>
  		<div class="card-body">Perhaps the most important concept in investing is diversification. Diversification means putting your money in a variety of financial vessels. Diversification is important because it lowers the level of risk in investing.
		</div>
		<hr id="examples">
		<div class="card-body"><p>For example, imagine you lived on an island where there were only two companies - one company sold sunscreen and one sold umbrellas. If you were to invest your entire portfolio in the company selling sunscreen, you would see strong performance during the sunny parts of the year, but poor performance when it rains. The reverse would occur if you placed all of your assets in the other company as well. Most investors would prefer to have steady and constant returns. The solution in this case might be to invest 50% in one company and 50% in the other. The result of this diversification is that you would have decent performance throughout the year, as opposed to excellent performance at one time and terrible at another.</p>

  			<div class="card-deck ml-3 mr-3 mb-3">
  					<div class="card">
  						<div class="card-header bg-primary"><b>Stocks</b></div>
  						<div class="card-body"> A stock is a share in the ownership of a company. Companies sell shares of stock (equity) of their company to shareholders to get money to grow their business. If the company is doing well, your stock share values may go up. If the company is not doing well, your stock share values may go down. As the old adage goes, you want to buy low and sell high.</div> 
  						<hr id="examples">
  						<div class="card-body"><h5><b>Pros and cons: </b></h5>
  							<p><b>Pros:</b> They have great potential to grow in value over time, and tend to have better performance and return on your investment in the long haul. </p>
							<p><b>Cons:</b> Stocks tend to be more volatile than bonds, meaning that their value goes up and down (fluctuates) more over short periods of time. This makes them a bit more of a risky investment.</p>
</div>
  					</div>
  			
  			
  					<div class="card">
  						<div class="card-header bg-warning"><b>Bonds</b></div>
  						<div class="card-body">A bond is a type of “I.O.U.”. When you buy a bond, you are lending money to whoever is issuing the bond (A company, government agency, corporation etc..), and in return you get interest on top of your original loan, thus making money on your investment. Interest payments are paid at a specific interest rate over a fixed time period. </div>
  						<hr id="examples">
  						<div class="card-body"><h5><b>Pros and cons: </b></h5>
  							<p><b>Pros:</b> Because the interest rate and time period are known, bonds are less volatile and risky than stocks.</p>
							<p><b>Cons:</b> They don’t have the growth potential that stocks do, so on average they are have worse performance than stocks in the long run. </p>

  		<div class="card-header bg-danger"><b>Mutual Funds and ETFs</b></div>
  		<div class="card-body">Investing in mutual funds and ETFs are easy ways to gain diversification in your portfolio</div> 
  			<div class="card-deck ml-3 mr-3 mb-3">
  					<div class="card">
  						<div class="card-header bg-secondary"><b>Mutual Funds</b></div>
  						<div class="card-body">A mutual fund is a collection of stocks, bonds, and other investments that is managed by a professional team. Individuals can buy shares in a mutual fund and all of the money is pooled. Mutual funds are often actively managed, meaning that the manager of the mutual fund then uses that money to buy and sell stocks, bonds, and other investments to increase the mutual fund’s value over time and try and beat the market. Mutual funds vary in their investments. Some mutual funds may only invest in stocks, whereas others may invest in only bonds, whereas some invest in a mix of stocks and bonds. </div> 
  						<hr id="examples">
  						<div class="card-body"><h5><b>Pros and cons: </b></h5>
  							<p><b>Pros:</b> The huge advantage to mutual funds is that you gain diversification at a very low price. 
</p>
							<p><b>Cons:</b> Since it is professionally managed, you don’t have as much control over your investment. There are also sometimes fees associated with a mutual fund or a large initial investment barrier which could be a detractor to potential investors.</p>
  					</div>
  					</div>
  			
  			
  					<div class="card">
  						<div class="card-header bg-light"><b>ETFs</b></div>
  						<div class="card-body">An ETF is an exchange-traded fund. ETFs are very similar to mutual funds. Just like mutual funds, an ETF is a collection of stocks, bonds, and other investments. ETFs generally try and track an index, meaning they are usually passively managed. This means  that there isn’t a management team making investment decisions. The goal of passive management is to generate a return that is the same as a chosen index (an index is a measurement of the stock market) rather than outperforming it. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs are traded like common stock and their price varies throughout a day. </div>
  						<hr id="examples">
  						<div class="card-body"><h5><b>Pros and cons: </b></h5>
  							<p><b>Pros:</b> Like mutual funds, ETFs are advantageous because you gain diversification at a very low price. ETFs often have lower fees and lower initial investment barriers than mutual funds. 
</p>
							<p><b>Cons:</b> Compared to individual stocks, ETFs often have higher fees.</p>
